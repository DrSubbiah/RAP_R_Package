# RAP_R_Package

RAP is an R package for detecting and analyzing reversal association patterns in contingency tables. It helps identify sub-tables showing reversal associations, visualize these patterns, and validate results through simulation methods — all implemented in pure R for easy use across platforms.
Here’s a draft **GitHub-style README.md** for your package **RAP** (Reversal Association Pattern Analysis). You can of course tweak wording, add visuals (e.g., vignette screenshots), and adjust sections to your liking.

## Overview  
`RAP` (Reversal Association Pattern Analysis for Categorical Data) is an R package that implements methods to detect *reversal associations* in contingency tables (i.e., sub-tables of I × J tables that exhibit reversal association patterns). It also provides visualization tools and simulation-based validation for more complex tables.

## Key Features  
- Detect sub-tables within I × J contingency tables showing reversal association patterns.  
- Provide visualizations of the detected patterns for easier interpretation.  
- Support simulation-based validation of findings for complex tables.  
- No compilation needed (pure R) — cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, Linux.  

## Installation  
Install the released version from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("RAP")
````

To get the latest development version (if you host on GitHub), you might use:

```r
# devtools::install_github("yourusername/RAP")
```

## Getting Started

Here’s a minimal example of how to use the package:

```r
library(RAP)

# Suppose you have some I × J contingency table `tbl`
# Example generating a sample table (for illustration):
tbl <- matrix(c(20, 10, 15,
                5, 25, 30,
                10, 15, 20), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE,
              dimnames = list(Row = c("A","B","C"),
                              Col = c("X","Y","Z")))

# Detect reversal-association patterns (function name is illustrative)
res <- detectRAP(tbl)

# Print summary of the detected sub-tables
print(res)

# Visualize the pattern 
plot(res)
```

(Refer to the package manual for exact function names and arguments.)
